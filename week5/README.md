## Professional Quality Typesetting with LaTeX

This week we will visit another publishing standard - [LaTeX2e](https://latex-project.org). You may have heard of it or not, you may have been intimidated by it or not. LaTeX is a typesetting engine which can help you write professional quality document which look like they just came from an actual typesetting press.  Yes, the one that prints ink on paper using metal casts.

We understand that this way of writing documents is not for everyone.  We just want to give you an introduction and then you can decide for yourself if it's worth to you.
