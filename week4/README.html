<h1 class="title">6/16 - Creating Your First R Package</h1>
</header>
<p>This week we will switch gears and delve into R programming. Assuming that everyone has worked in R for their data analysis and visualization needs, you must have accumulated quite a bit of R code. This probably includes some small snippets or functions that you may have used on a recurring basis. <strong>How frustrating was it to have to find this code over and over again?</strong></p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if we just converted these R functions into a package that you keep installed as an R library and have access to it whenever you need it? This week we will do just that.</p>
<h2 id="must-do-preparation">Must Do Preparation</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>R/R-Studio Installation</strong>: Install the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">latest version of R (4.0.1)</a> and <a href="https://rstudio.com">R-Studio</a> Desktop.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R Packages</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Devtools</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>Roxygen2</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>Tidyverse</code> family of packages</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>R Code</strong>: Bring some of your home brewed R code. This can be as simple and as complex as you would like. For the first round of package creation, we will develop functions during the session. But for the second round, it would be nice if everyone used their own.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GitHub Account</strong>: If this is your first time attending the SOC2020 program, please make sure to have access to a GitHub account (i.e. remember username/password). We will be publishing these R package on GitHub.</p></li>
</ul>
