## Adopting Tidyverse For Your Data Analysis

During the next 2 weeks, we will focus on [Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) which are a powerful group of packages for data analysis.  While you can do a lot with the Base-R distribution, these packages may change your life.  As [Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.co.nz) suggests, the packages allowed for modifying important functions in R without having to change (read: break) the base-R code.  

We will dedicate two weeks to this topics because there are quite a few packages to cover. We will loosely follow Wickham and Grolemund's excellent book: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz).  However, we will strive to use biological data sets to work through the individual package functions.

### Preparation

There is not much to do, but make sure you will have the ``tidyverse`` family of packages installed and take a look at the book linked above.  The entire book is available for free online.


```r

devtools::install_github("hadley/tidyverse")
