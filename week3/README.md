## 1. Basic Operations in GitKraken


- We will catch up on using Git and GitHub using the GUI client: GitKraken

- Connecting your GitHub account to GitKraken

- Create new repositories locally and on GitHub

- Open existing repositories locally

- Editing and Adding files within GitKraken

- Pushing updated repositories to GitHub 


## 2. Collaborative Work Using git and Github


Collaborative work is where Git and GitHub come in very handy.  There are numerous scenarios as to how collaborative transactions might play out using these tools.  We will consider some of the common situations and navigate them using simple, easy to understand examples.
 

- **Invite Collaborators**: Once you upload a repository to GitHub, how do you invite collaborators? How do you decide whether to make your project public or private?

- **You are the collaborator**: You have been invited as a collaborator; Now what? How to access the shared repo, edit/add to it and upload the changes.

- **Improving the works of others**: You find a useful repo that you think could use some new features/improvements. How do you go about contributing to this public project?

- **Accepting/Rejecting changes requested by others**: You are the owner of a publicly available repo.  Another scientist/programmer makes changes/improvements to your code and sends you a request to include their code in your repo. What steps do you need to take?


**Note**: We may post some instructions here for preparations in the next day or so.  Please make sure to revisit this repo sometime after 5pm on Friday, June 05.
