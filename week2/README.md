# June 02, 2020: Version Control, GitHub and More Markdown

## 1. Preparation

- Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

- If you have a Mac, git is included (type ``git --version`` in terminal to confirm). 

	- **Important note**: If you recently updated your OSX version, and are getting ``missing xcrun`` error messages, you need to install XCODE as well as the commandline tools. Try: ``xcode --install`` in the terminal.

- Install [GitKraken - A GUI ``git`` client](https://www.gitkraken.com/) for your operating system 

- Make a free GitHub account and keep your user/password combination handy

- If you haven't yet signed up for the Slack channel, please do so. We will not send out weekly emails to everyone about next week's preppp.  All details will be posted to GitHub and a notification about it will be sent to the Slack Channel.

- Bring a recent project. This should include:

	- Data analysis code in any language (R, Python, BASH, Java -- whatever floats your boat)

	- A text file containing description of the analysis

	- One or two (or more if you wish) figures

	- Alternatively (in lieu of both items above), bring another academic product of yours. 

- We will typset these contents using Markdown, create a local project and then learn to archive it on GitHub using:

	- ``Commandline`` version of git
	
	- ``GitKraken`` i.e. the GUI version of git
